Games and AI are getting real complex... so we added in TWO... count em... TWO more options >:)

## Features
- No major features, went for the MVP here, and focused on dotting my I's and crossing my T's.


## Possible Future Extensions
  - I do think having more emojis to pick from would be cool, so I can pick an angry face if I feel like it OR to match my mood.
